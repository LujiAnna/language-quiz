# Language quiz

- Repository: `language-quiz`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `1-2 day(s)`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning Objectives
- Apply OOP in PHP
- Adhere to the [best practises](../00.Getting-started-with-PHP/PHP-best-practises.md) we've assembled together

## The Mission
We're a couple of months in, and you're still going strong! ðŸ’ª
Still... there might be days when you feel tired of learning how to code - maybe you want to learn a new language instead? We'll combine both skills by building a language quiz!

To get you kickstarted, a [starter pack](Starter-pack) is provided ðŸš€

### ðŸŒ± Must-haves

- The user gets a word from the list to translate
- On submit, the answer gets validated, and the user get a success / fail message

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have (doable)

- Retain the user score when he or she plays again with another word
- Allow a user to click a reset button and start over completely

### ðŸŒ³ Nice to have (hard)

- Have a phase before the quiz starts where you ask the nickname from the user
- Scoring will now be split in right and wrong answers
- Once the number of 10 right or wrong answers is reached, show an ending screen with the scoring
